# Smart-Irrigation-System-Using-Iot 🌱

👉🏻INTRODUCTION:

Agriculture remains the backbone of many economies, yet traditional irrigation methods often lead to water wastage and inefficient resource use. A Smart Irrigation System using IoT (Internet of Things) aims to solve this problem by automating irrigation based on real-time environmental data such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. This not only conserves water but also ensures optimal growth conditions for crops.

The system employs sensors to collect data, a microcontroller (like Arduino) to process it, and optionally a Wi-Fi module (like ESP8266) to transmit data to a cloud server or local backend, where it can be visualized and analyzed.
Here ,

          i)✅soil moisture.
          ii)✅temperature. 
          iii)✅humidity. 
          
the above levels are the main and basic inputs for our project.based on the inputs either it is manually or real-time.
and our outputs for the inputs are;

          i)✅ predicted crops.
          ⅱ)✅Soil damage.
          ⅱi)✅water level.
          iv)✅water scarcity.
          v)✅fertilizer Suggestion.

👉🏻IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

1)install arduino uno in your pc
2)install the dependencies in arduino uno, based on the hardware components you have , like : soil moisture sensor, DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity
3)select proper boards and ports while implementing..
4)arduino file contains arduino code(c++) , which is very important for the hardware setup.
5)compile and upload arduino code..
6)make sure that all the depencies must be installed (ex.arduino uno)
7)extract the downloaded folder
8)keep all hardware components connected to node MCU , which is our wifi module..
9)an then connect that wifi module to our pc using b cable 
      NOTE: use a cable which transfers the data efficiently ,not only which gives power connection supply
10)double click on the run.bat file directly u can see some instructions with outputs..
11)check your ui and testing is done.!

🌾Conclusion:

  The Smart Irrigation System using IoT presents a sustainable and efficient solution for modern agriculture. By utilizing real-time data from soil moisture, temperature,      and humidity sensors, the system ensures that water is used only when necessary, thereby reducing wastage and conserving resources. The integration of IoT enables remote     monitoring, automation, and data analysis, which enhances decision-making and minimizes manual effort.

  This project demonstrates how technology can be leveraged to improve agricultural practices, making them more intelligent, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.      With further development, such systems can be scaled and customized to meet the diverse needs of farmers and gardeners, contributing significantly to the advancement of      smart farming and precision agriculture.
